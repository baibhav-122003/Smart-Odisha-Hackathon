# Unified Crop Insurance Interface
## Project Description
This project is aimed at building an unified web interface, where farmers, insurance agents and government officials can come together, to make the complete process of claiming Crop Insurance much more efficient, faster and transparent for all the stakeholders.

The primary problems which we are addressing in this project are as follows:
1. Delay in settlement of crop Insurance Claims.
2. Frequent rejections of Insurance Claims by Insurance Companies.
3. Complicated process of claim settlement arouses confusion among farmers.
4. Eradicating human interference.

## Proposed Solution
We have built a web interface providing following solutions:
### For farmers:
1. Track there insurance application in following steps:
  1. If the validation process by the insurance companies has been started or not.
  2. If the insurance claim has been approved or not.
  3. If the insurance company has released the fund or not.
  4. If the farmer has received the fund or not.
2. Contact the government officials directly form our platform.

### For Insurance Companies:
1. Modify the application status of all the customers, directly on the dashboard, through a dropdown menu.
2. Serve a large number of genuine customers easily and in a more organized manner.

### For Government and Statutory Bodies:
1. Have an overwatch over all the farmers under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna.
2. Reach large number of farmers easily, and in a better manner.
3. Better communicate with the farmers, and avoid confusion and misinformation among farmers.
